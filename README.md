This project was developed using BabylonJS, a javascript 3D game engine. I developed this game to get a feel for 3D game development in a familiar language. There is an issue with the collision detection and it has yet to be solved. I plan to incorporate multiplayer features and a neural network learning algorithm into this game at some point, after fixing the collision detection. I also plan to integrate VR support with the goal to create a casual atmosphere to play chess in VR with friends and strangers in interesting environments through the use of 360 video.
